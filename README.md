## Usage

Create an account with an email/password. Using the email and password on the login screen at the login page will direct the user to a dropdown menu.

Current homes are shown in the dropdown; selecting a home will render all the rooms within the home. A new room can be added by the user through the add button, and rooms can also be removed via the corresponding button on the room card. When a room is selected, the user will be presented with all devices linked to the room.

The device settings can be manipulated and a new device can be added as well.
